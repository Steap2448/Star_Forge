# Software Development Plan

1. Description
    * A university project that allows its user to create, save and load star systems. 
    * Numerical method for ordinary differential equations, Cauchy problem, star system simulation, graphics, file operations.
2. Design
    * Initial thoughts in UML (a work in progress)
    * Limitations - work in progess
    * Environment - Linux, g++
3. Development
    * Components (Interface)

    * No tests yet
    * Integration 
4. Milestones
