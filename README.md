# Star_Forge
A university project. The goal is a program which lets the user create a custom star system and simulate already created models. The user can also save the system he created in order to load it later, along with some premade ones.

The project uses [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) for working with windows and sounds, and uses the Runge–Kutta and Dormand–Prince methods for calculating the movements of celestial bodies.

In order to run the program download the files, and compile main_menu_last.cpp using the following command: **g++ -std=c++11 main_menu_last.cpp -lsfml-window -lsfml-system -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-audio**
